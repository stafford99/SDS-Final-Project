# SDS-Final-Project
Here is the code I used throughout my final project. What is very important to note is that you must download the html document (right click and select 'save as') to your computer. This way when you open it from your saved documents, it will open as a nice web page with all of my code displayed. 

The additional RDS files are necessary to read in to RStudio to complete the code. 

Thanks for reading!
